# Smart-Gesture-Based-Media-Controller
Smart Gesture-Based Media Controller lets users control media with simple hand gestures using an ESP32 and MPU6050 accelerometer. A lightweight ML model recognizes gestures in real time and triggers actions like play/pause, volume, and track switching via a Flask server, offering a low-cost, touchless, and customizable solution.
